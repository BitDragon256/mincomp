    # terracotta using the Java and Bedrock formats respectively.

    # Note that the format you define the block in does not need to match the world you are writing the block to.
    # The translator will handle block translating it to the correct format.

    # First we need to define the Block object for each of the formats.

    )
    # Block(universal_minecraft:glazed_terracotta[color="green",facing="south"]), None, False

    # The boolean output at the end can for the most part be ignored but lets explain the use of it.
    # There are certain cases that require more than just the block state to fully define the block.
    # If the translator is not able to fully define the translation it will return that value as True.
    # The calling code can then give it more data to fully define the translation.

    # Blocks with a block entity is a simple example.
    # Doing the translation without the block entity will use the default NBT data and return the value as True.
    # The calling code can then call the translator again with the block entity.

    # Another example is multi-block structures such as doors in older versions of the game.
    # Doors used to split the state data over the bottom and top block.
    # The translator has the ability to reach back into the world to inspect neighbour blocks to get this extra data.
    # This is done through a callback function given to the translator.

    # Now we now have the universal block state converted from both Bedrock and Java. Lets set the data in the level.

    # First we need to register the Block objects with the block palette to get the runtime block id.
    block_id_1 = level.block_palette.get_add_block(universal_block_1)
    block_id_2 = level.block_palette.get_add_block(universal_block_2)
    # In this case the two translations gave the same universal block object so the block ids are the same.

    # This code was documented in the previous example so I won't do it again.
